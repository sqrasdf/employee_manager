# Employee Manager â€“ Spring Boot REST API

**Employee Manager** is a RESTful API built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, designed for efficient management of employees, groups, and ratings. The application provides endpoints to create, delete, and retrieve data, as well as export employee information to **CSV** and calculate **group occupancy rates**.
